introduction: "Or close the wall up with our English dead. In peace there's nothing so becomes a man As modest stillness and humility: But when the blast of war blows in our ears, Then imitate the action of the tiger;"

William Shakespeare (/ˈʃeɪkspɪər/; 26 April 1564 (baptised) – 23 April 1616) was an English poet, playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet, and the "Bard of Avon". His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.

Shakespeare was born and brought up in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613, at age 49, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive, which has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, sexuality, and religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others.

### People Who Live Alone Have Terrible Diets

A recent study of Australians who live alone found that they eat a less diverse amount of food, with fruits and vegetables being the most compromised food group. And, as anyone who shops for themselves can vouch, feeding yourself is much harder than feeding multiple mouths. Like most things that are good in life, healthy foods are expensive and spoil long before you can get your money's worth. The good news is that it'll soon be winter in the Northern Hemisphere, so just buy a bunch of produce and turn it into a tasty stew or soup. Sure you'll be eating it for lunch and dinner for the rest of the week, but it's for your own good.

### Is It Enough?

Another recent study showed that, no, it isn't enough. What isn't enough? We're not sure, but whatever it is, it isn't. Enough that is. Is this sentence confusing? It damn well should be! What's the point in a sentence that isn't confusing?

Nothing. That's what.

*Jekyll* also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [*Jekyll* docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of *Jekyll*. File all bugs/feature requests at [*Jekyll’s* GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [*Jekyll* Talk][jekyll-talk].

Further to that, we can `inline` code snippets. I hope.
